# quicksortforpascal
The QuickSort algorithm from https://wiki.freepascal.org/Array_sort, with more descriptive names and bugfix

The purpose of this repository is simply to make the quicksort algoritm published on freepascal.org also available for my other projects.

This is basically the same unit given by the original developers, but the bug reported under https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,34955.15.html is fixed and the names are replaced to have more descriptive names.

For the usage of the sorting algorithm check the attached demo program.
